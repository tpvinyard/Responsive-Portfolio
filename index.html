      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <img id="bio-image" src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I am from a small town in south Texas of about 7,000 people called Gonzales. It was your typical small-town experience: everyone knew everyone, football was king, and there was never anything to do except get into trouble. With that said, my parents were always "city-folk" at heart so as I grew up, I became more and more eager to leave. Fast-forward 10 years spent in Austin, TX, and I now call myself a legitimate Austinite.</p>
      <p>I attended The University of Texas at Austin and graduated with bachelor's degrees in Astronomy and Physics. I am an avid adventurer, photographer, cyclist, trumpet player, UT football fanatic, corgi lover, and budding software developer.</p>
      <p>Although my two places that I have called home could not be more polar opposite, I like to think that they have both shaped and melded me into who I am today.</p>
